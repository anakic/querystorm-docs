# Introduction to QueryStorm

## About these docs

Welcome to the QueryStorm documentation. You can read these pages from beginning to end, or pick and choose topics that interest you. SQL users, for example, can freely skip sections that cover .NET related topics.

Each section of the documentation starts with an overview page explaining the core concepts covered in the section.

## What is QueryStorm

QueryStorm is an Excel add-in that brings first class support for modern programming languages (namely SQL, C# and VB.NET) into Excel. It is intended to enhance Excel's native functionality with a strong set of technical capabilities.

It has three main areas of use:

1. Processing and migrating data using SQL and C#/Linq
2. Developing and sharing custom Excel functions using SQL, C# and VB.NET
3. Automating workbooks with with SQL, C# and VB.NET

## Who it's for

The main audiences for QueryStorm can be split into three distinct groups:

- **Data specialists** such as database professionals, data scientists and data analysts use it to facilitate processing of data in Excel, and moving data between Excel and databases.
- **Developers**  use if for processing data in Excel as well as for building custom Excel functions and workbook applications for their clients and business users.
- **Business users** use it to make use of the custom functions and workbook applications that developers build for them.

## IDE and Runtime

QueryStorm consists of two parts: the **IDE** and the **Runtime**.

These are two separate add-ins that function independently. The main QueryStorm installer installs both parts, but the runtime can also be installed separately via its own (smaller) installer.

The IDE is used by data professionals and developers for data processing and for creating custom functions and workbook applications. The Runtime is used by business users for installing and using those custom solutions.
