# What's new in QueryStorm 2

We're extremely excited to welcome you to the release of QueryStorm version 2!

QueryStorm v2 has been over a year in the making and is a comprehensive overhaul of the original version. It includes several major new features and hundreds of smaller changes and improvements.

Please note that some features have not yet been migrated (e.g. quick queries). Also, QueryStorm2 is not compatible with the original version of QueryStorm and will not be able to see any embedded code files in workbooks made with the original version.

That said, QueryStorm2 can run side-by side with the original version of QueryStorm allowing for an incremental transition.

So without further ado, here's what's new in QueryStorm 2...

## New project system

Code files in QueryStorm are organized into projects. Projects contain user code, scripts, and configuration files, and are fairly similar to projects in Visual Studio. Projects are designed to be compiled and the compilation outputs loaded by the QueryStorm runtime.

## Automation changes

In the previous version of QueryStorm, automation was set up using the Automation pane in the UI. The Automation pane allowed defining jobs that specified a sequence of scripts to execute and a list of events that trigger the execution of the job.

In the new version of QueryStorm, the automation pane is no longer there, but much richer, more stable and better performing automation capabilities are now available via code.

Automation can now be defined via C#/VB.NET code or via a simple preprocessor syntax in SQL scripts.

### Model-binding

Workbook projects can automate workbooks using C# and/or VB.NET and QueryStorm's model-binding API. The model-binding API lets you to focus on your business logic rather than on interacting with Excel.

The example below illustrates a component that controls the behavior of part of a workbook. The binding attributes connect the component to the workbook, and no part of the code interacts with the workbook directly (though it can, when needed).

```csharp
public class SampleComponent : ComponentBase
{
    [Bind("searchText")]
    public string SearchText { get; set; }

    [BindTable]
    public PeopleTable People{ get; set; }

    private string _Message;
    [Bind("messages")]
    public string Message
    {
        get => _Message;
        set { _Message = value; OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Message)); }
    }

    [EventHandler("searchText")]
    public void Test()
    {
        Message = $"Searched for '{SearchText}' at {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}";

        People.ForEach(t =>
        {
            string nameWithoutStar = t.FirstName.TrimEnd('*');
            if(t.FirstName.IndexOf(SearchText, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0)
                t.FirstName = nameWithoutStar + "*";
            else
                t.FirstName = nameWithoutStar;
        });

        People.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

### SQL based automation

SQL users can set up automation using an expanded preprocessor syntax (instead of the Automation pane).

```sql
-- specify the triggers that call the command
{handles orderDate}

-- output results into the 'orders' table
{@orders}
select
    *
from
    Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
where
    OrderDate = @orderDate -- read the orderDate cell's value
```

In the example above, the script is executed every time the cell with the name `orderData` is changed. The same cell is used as a parameter in the where clause of the query, and the query results are outputted into a workbook table named `orders`.

## NuGet support

QueryStorm now includes NuGet support that lets you reference NuGet packages in your projects to automate workbooks or build custom Excel functions.

## VB.NET support

QueryStorm now supports using VB.NET for automating workbooks and building custom functions.

## Independent tabs

In the previous version of QueryStorm all script tabs shared the same connection. In the new version of QueryStorm, each tab is its own context, so you can have e.g. a SQL Server connection in one tab, and a SQLite connection in another.

## IDE improvements

The IDE now offers an even better code editing experience with capabilities such as code refactorings, symbol renaming, navigating from errors to source and better performance for smoother code editing.

## Publishing and installing functions

QueryStorm now includes a mechanism of sharing functions between users. Users of the full version of QueryStorm can create functions and publish them via a network share or via a proprietary Azure Artifacts server. Users with the QueryStorm runtime can then download and install these packages (provided they have access to the repository).

![Installing a function](https://www.querystorm.com/docs2/Images/installing_packages.gif)

QueryStorm Runtime users can also make use of the official packages the QueryStorm team releases. For example, one such functions contains a `Query` function, similar to the one in GoogleSheets (even better in that it allows joining tables).

## Separate runtime

The QueryStorm runtime is now distributed separately as a smaller installer. The runtime is intended primarily for business users and allows them to run automated workbooks and to install packages with custom functions. The installer for the runtime is ~8MB in size, while the installer for the full version is ~31MB.

The full version includes the runtime, so it's not necessary to download the runtime separately if you're using the full version.

## Missing features

As mentioned, some features of the original version of QueryStorm are not yet implemented. This primarily includes:

- Quick queries
- Support for Oracle, access and DB2 support

Additionally, support for the new window function in SQLite is also not yet included, though this was not included in the previous versions either. Aside from this,
