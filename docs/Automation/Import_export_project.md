# Importing and exporting code

Workbook projects can be exported to a folder on the local machine and later imported into another workbook (or the same workbook).

This makes it easier to:

- update an existing workbook with a new version of the code
- reuse the same code in multiple workbooks
- version control workbook code
- protect intellectual property by keeping only the output dlls in the workbook while keeping the source code only on your local machine.

The following gif illustrates the process of exporting a project and importing it into a new workbook:
