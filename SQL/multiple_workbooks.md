# Multiple workbooks

You can connect to tables from multiple workbooks. The workbooks have to be opened in order for this to work, so this is primarily useful for ad hoc purposes rather than automation. 

There are two ways to include tables from multiple Excel files in the session.

## Via the drop-down button in the ribbon

## Via custom connection

This option allows explicitly selecting tables that are to be available in the session.
