# Overview: Creating Excel functions
QueryStorm enables user to add new functions to Excel, and to make these functions available to other users.

The full version of QueryStorm is required for creating functions, while the Runtime version is sufficient to run them. 

> The Runtime is included in the full version.

## Supported languages
QueryStorm lets you define new Excel functions using **SQL**, **C#** and **VB.NET**. 

### SQL
Defining functions in SQL is useful for returning data from the database, based on zero or more parameters passed in from Excel. The function body is written in SQL, and the function declaration in a simple preprocessesory syntax that's available in all SQL scripts in QueryStorm.

### C# and VB.NET
Building functions in C# and VB.NET is a matter of writing the code of the function and decorating it with the `[ExcelFunction]` attribute. The function might perform a calculation itself, or it might call into some third party library or a REST service. The user can choose the language (C# or VB.NET) they wish to use in the `module.config` file. To read more about creating functions with C# and VB.NET, click [here](todo).

## Kinds of functions
Functions can be defined inside a particular **workbook** or in an **extension package**.

### Workbook functions
Functions that are defined inside a workbook are only available to that workbook. The advantage to this is that they will be immediately available to others when they open a copy of your workbook (provided they have the QueryStorm runtime), so you don't need to distribute them separately.

### Extension functions
Functions can also be defined in *extension packages*. Functions contained in an extension package are usable in any workbook on the machine. Additionally, authors can easily publish their extension packages  to make them available to other (QueryStorm Runtime) users. Click [here](todo) for more information about extension projects.
