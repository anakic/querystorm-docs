# Introduction to QueryStorm

Welcome to the QueryStorm documentation. This documentation will give you an overview of the functionality that's included in QueryStorm and explains its core concepts. Sections include textual as well as video material, both of which cover the same content.

## What is QueryStorm

QueryStorm is an Excel add-in that brings first class support for modern programming languages (namely SQL, C# and VB.NET) into Excel. It is intended to enhance Excel's native functionality, flexibility and powerful user interface with a strong technical tool set.

It has three main areas of use:

- Querying, processing and migrating data using SQL and Linq
- Building and sharing custom Excel functions with SQL, C# and VB.NET
- Automating workbooks with with SQL, C# and VB.NET

## Who it's for

The main audiences for QueryStorm can be split into three distinct groups.

Data professionals, such as database specialists, data scientists and data analysts use it to facilitate processing of data in Excel, and moving data between Excel and databases.

Developers also use if for processing data in Excel, but also for building custom Excel functions and workbook applications for their clients and users.

Business users use it to make use of the custom functions and workbook applications that developers build for them.

## IDE and Runtime

QueryStorm consists of two parts: the **IDE** and the **Runtime**. These are two separate add-ins that function independently. The IDE is a COM add-in, and the runtime is an XLL Excel add-in.

Data professionals and developers use the IDE for data processing as well as for creating custom functions and workbook applications, while business users use the Runtime for installing and using those custom solutions.

The full version of QueryStorm includes the IDE and the Runtime. Business users, however, can download and license the runtime separately.
