# Model-binding

The model binding approach to building workbook applications is designed to minimize the amount of code you need to write to interact with Excel.

Click below for a video example of the model-binding approach:

## The application class

The workbook project has an `App` class that's defined in the `App.cs` (or `App.vb`) file. This is the entry point of the application. With the model binding approach, most of the logic resides inside component classes. The only thing we need to do in the `App` class is add registrations for any services that might be needed by components.

## Components

A component class contains logic that controls a section of the workbook. You can have any number of components in a workbook, each controlling it's own (arbitrarily defined) part of the workbook.

Components have the following characteristics:

- They can accept dependencies via constructor injection.
- Public properties of a component can be data-bound to cells in Excel via the `[Bind]` attribute.
- The methods of the component can handle events coming from Excel (e.g. button click), which is specified using the `[EventHandler]` attribute.

For example, the following component will read input values from two excel cells, and pop up a MessageBox when the user clicks a button:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using QueryStorm.Core;
using static QueryStorm.Core.DebugHelpers;

namespace Project
{
	public class Component1 : ComponentBase
	{
		private DateTime date;
		private string name;
		private readonly IDialogService dialogService;
		
        // get the dialogService instance via constructor injection
		public Component1(IDialogService dialogService)
		{
			this.dialogService = dialogService;
		}
		
		// bind to a cell with the name "name"
		[Bind("name")]
		public string Name
		{
		    get => name;
		    set { name = value; OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Name)); }
		}
		
		// bind to a cell with the name "dateOfBirth"
		[Bind("dateOfBirth")]
		public DateTime Date
		{
		    get => date;
		    set { date = value; OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Date)); }
		}
		
		// handle the click of an ActiveX button
		[EventHandler("Sheet1!CommandButton1")]
		public void Test()
		{
			if(DateTime.Today.Day == Date.Day && DateTime.Today.Month == Date.Month)
				dialogService.ShowInfo($"Well happy birthday to ya, {Name}!", "", "It's your birthday");
			else
				dialogService.ShowInfo($"Hey there {Name}, how's things?", "", "Hello");
		}
	}
}
```

## Bindings

Component properties can be bound to ranges in Excel. This is achieved by using the `[Bind(nameOfCell)]` attribute. The attribute accepts a single parameter that specifies the name of the cell that should be bound to. If the property name is the same as the name of the cell, the argument can be omitted.

### Two-way binding

By default, bindings work in both directions. When the value of a bound cell changes, the corresponding property of the component is updated. When a property changes, it should raise a `PropertyChanged` event by calling e.g. `OnPropertyChange(nameof(MyProperty123))`. This will let the binding infrastructure know that the property value has changed and the new value will be written into the cell.

### Binding tables

A component's property can also bind to an Excel table. This is done using the `[BindTable(tableName)]` attribute.

The type of the property should be the type that the [data context](todo) generated for the table. If the project does not have a data context file, it can be created from the context menu of the project. This file can be customized in order to influence column types and add relations between tables. Each time this file is saved, strongly typed classes that represent tables and rows will be generated under it.

![Example data context](../../Images/example_data_context.png)

In the image above, we're binding a property to the `Projects` table. The property as well as the generated type are also called Projects.

In cases where you do not need strongly typed access to the table, the type of the property can be `Tabular`. The `Tabular` class represent a table of data, but it's rows do not offer strongly typed access to the data. Access to data is allowed via indexers.

These properties allow the component to read data from tables. To write data to a table, you can update the table and call `table.SaveChanges()`:

```csharp
[EventHandler("SelectBest")]
public void SaveProject()
{

}
```

### Bindings bind to a data context

It's important to note that components aren't directly bound to Excel. Instead they are bound to a [data context](todo). For workbook applications, this data context happens to be a `WorkbookDataContext` instance that exposes data and events from the workbook. If you need to customize the data context, you should define your own data add a data context file to the project and customize it.

## Events

Public methods of components can handle events coming in from the workbook. To do so, they need to marked with the `EventHandler` attribute that specifies the event name. Multiple `EventHandler` attributes should be applied to a method, in case it needs to handle multiple events.

Currently, the following event sources are supported:

- ActiveX button (Click)
- Range (value changed)
- VBA (sent via the QueryStorm Runtime API)

The event name, that is the single argument to the `EventHandler` attribute, determines which event the method handles.

### Handling button click events

When a method needs to handle the click of a button, the following syntax should be used for the event name: `{sheetName}!{buttonName}`. 

For example, to handle the click of an ActiveX button named `MyButton` located on a sheet named `Sheet1`, the method should be decorated as follows:

```csharp
[EventHandler("Sheet1!MyButton")]
public void MyEventHandlerMethod()
{
    // ...
}
```

### Handling range value changes

When a method needs to be called every time a range changes, the name of the range should used as the event name:

```csharp
[EventHandler("nameOfTheCell")]
public void MyEventHandlerMethod()
{
    // ...
}
```

### Events from VBA

Events can be sent from VBA code to the workbook application. One reason this might be useful is it allows using regular buttons, instead of ActiveX buttons which have known issues when changing resolution (e.g. second screen, projector).

To send an event from VBA, use a `QueryStorm.Runtime.API` object:

```vb
CreateObject("QueryStorm.Runtime.API").SendEvent("myEvent")
```

`QueryStorm.Runtime.API` objects are light weight objects that forward events to the Runtime. They carry no state and do not need to be cached.

## Mixing model-binding with COM automation

Usually components rely on bindings to handle the plumbing of communicating with Excel. When needed, the component can also interact directly with the workbook, by requesting an `IWorkbookAccessor` instance in its constructor.
