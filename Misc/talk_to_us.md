# Talk to us

We try our best to offer stable software and good documentation. Never the less, both this documentation and QueryStorm are work in progress and errors are bound to slip through the cracks here and there. If you notice any bugs or inconsistencies, or you have a question/idea/suggestion, please let us know! You can get in touch via the Disqus section at the bottom of each document in the docs, via [email](mailto:hello@querystorm.com?subject=Hello QueryStorm) or via the chat pop-up in the bottom right corner of the [main page](https://www.querystorm.com).
